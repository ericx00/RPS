Rock Paper Siscor game in blockchain
To incorporate the improvements into our decentralized Rock-Paper-Scissors game on the Aptos blockchain, the code will be more extensive and involve multiple modules to handle different functionalities. Iâ€™ll provide a modular breakdown to maintain clarity and explain each section.

Here is the refactored and improved code with explanations:
1. Game Module

We'll start with the base game module and add several enhancements, such as betting, leaderboards, player stats, and anti-cheat mechanisms.
Key Enhancements and Explanations

    Betting System
        Players place a bet amount when starting the game using the start_game function. The bet amount is deducted from the player's balance, and winnings are paid out based on the game result.

    Leaderboard and Player Stats
        Player statistics are tracked in the PlayerStats struct, updated after each game. The get_player_stats function provides the ability to view individual stats.
        A global Leaderboard struct is used to store the top players. This can be updated periodically or after every game.

    Game History and Anti-Cheat
        Each game has a timestamp to track when it started, preventing players from cheating by delaying moves.
        Additional fields or logic can be added to detect fraudulent behavior, such as repeated moves within short time frames.

    NFT Rewards and Achievements
        To implement NFTs as rewards, you could create another module that interfaces with an NFT contract on the Aptos blockchain to mint NFTs based on player achievements.

    Time-Limited Moves
        The timestamp field in the Game struct allows you to set and enforce time limits on moves. Players exceeding the time limit can be automatically penalized.

    Game Customization
        To add customization options, another struct PlayerPreferences could be created to store different preferences like themes, avatars, etc. This would involve storing preferences and fetching them during the game render.

    Decentralized Governance
        A new Governance module can be created to allow players to propose changes and vote on game updates. This would involve creating functions for submitting proposals, voting, and executing changes based on vote results.
2. Governance Module
    Explanation of the Governance Module

    Proposals: This module allows players to create proposals (create_proposal), cast votes (vote), and execute decisions (execute_proposal).
    Decentralization: Players can directly influence the game by voting on new features, rules, or changes.
